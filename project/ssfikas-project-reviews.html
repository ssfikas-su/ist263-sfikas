                    <h2>Joker</h2>
                    <h3>Directed by Todd Phillips</h3>
                    <p>
                        Few movies have the impact that "Joker" has had in Hollywood. The film
                        has dominated conversation in most film communities for the past few months
                        after receiving the Golden Lion award at Venice Film Festival. The first 
                        comic book film to do so. The film has also been discussed and marketed 
                        as a more "serious" alternative to tradtional comic book films. Putting the controversy
                        aside, "Joker" holds its own as a standalone character study of one of the most famous
                        characters in both cinema and comic books...

                    <h2>Rushmore</h2>
                    <h3>Directed by Wes Anderson</h3>
                    <p>
                        Rushmore is the first live action Wes Anderson movie I have seen. It seems clear 
                        to me now why Wes Anderson is lauded as one of the most idiosyncratic directors of this 
                        generation. Rushmore is an incredibly charming and funny coming-of-age story with a unique
                        visual style that Anderson would eventually become famous for. Jason Schwartzman and Bill Murray
                        deliver great performances and have great comedic chemistry...
