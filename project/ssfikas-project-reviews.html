                        <h3>Directed by Todd Phillips</h3>
                        <p>
                            Few movies have the impact that "Joker" has had in Hollywood. The film
                            has dominated conversation in most film communities for the past few months
                            after receiving the Golden Lion award at Venice Film Festival. The first 
                            comic book film to do so. The film has also been discussed and marketed 
                            as a more "serious" alternative to tradtional comic book films. Putting the controversy
                            aside, "Joker" holds its own as a standalone character study of one of the most famous
                            characters in both cinema and comic books.

                        <h3>Directed by Wes Anderson</h3>
                        <p>
                            Rushmore is the first live action Wes Anderson movie I have seen. It seems clear 
                            to me now why Wes Anderson is lauded as one of the most idiosyncratic directors of this 
                            generation. Rushmore is an incredibly charming and funny coming-of-age story with a unique
                            visual style that Anderson would eventually become famous for. This film was able to bump 
                            a lot of Wes Anderson films up my watchlist.

                        <h2>Do The Right Thing</h2>
                        <p>
                            "Do The Right Thing" had been on my watchlist forever. I had known almost nothing about it
                            except that it was Spike Lees most acclaimed film. After watching his last feature in theaters, 
                            I knew I had to watch more of his films. When browsing my local video store I found a recent remaster 
                            of the film so I decided to finally watch it and I'm glad I did. "Do The Right Thing" succeeds greatly
                            in telling avery heavy story in a very entertaining and enjoyable format. The film juggles a diverse cast of characters
                            that are all entertaining in their own right, however, it's the films plot that shines. Lee builds tension throughout
                            the entire film that ends in an emotional and intense climax that makes the film as masterful as it is.

                        <h2>Shaun of the Dead</h2>
                        <p>
                            I was introduced by Edgar Wright when I watched "Hot Fuzz" on Netflix in High School. "Hot Fuzz" was everything I wanted as a young film fan.
                            It was stylish, it was violent, and it was funny. Later in my life I watched other Wright films such as "Scott Pilgrim vs. The World" and 
                            "Baby Driver". "Shaun of the Dead" always appealed to me, but I never had gotten a chance to watch it until recently. While being just as
                            enjoyable as Wright's later films, I feel that "Shaun of the Dead" is a lot less original and less fun than his later films. It is certainly a 
                            capable film made by a talented filmmaker, but I believe his talent increased as he continued making films.
