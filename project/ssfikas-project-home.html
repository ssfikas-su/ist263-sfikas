                        <p>
                            Army of Darkness, directed by Sam Raimi, is the finale in
                            the cult classic "Evil Dead" trilogy. The famous horror trilogy,
                            however, ends with a lighthearted and comedic action/adventure film
                            rather than the low-budget campy horror flicks that preceded it. For this reason,
                            Army of Darkness has little reason to be as successful as it is. It is a complete 
                            departure from everything that makes the first two films so famous, and yet it 
                            furthers the lore and the character of Ash, giving them the end they deserve. Packed with
                            slapstick comedy and one-liners, Army of Darkness is a fun watch for sure.

                        <p>If you have ever heard something referred to as "Lynchian", chances are 
                            it's very weird. David Lynch's work thrives in the world of weird. 
                            Lynch has mastered the art of surrealist cinema, beginning his career with the 
                            cult classic horror film "Eraserhead", and creating a worldwide phenomenon with his 
                            sensational TV series "Twin Peaks", Lynch has cemented himself as a master of cinema and his films
                            have had a profound impact on me throughout the years. Every time I watch a Lynch film, I am in awe of
                            the incredibly imagery and the disturbingly relevant themes consistent in all of his work.

                    <h4>About Steve</h4>
                    <p>
                        Steve is a student studying Information Management and Technology at Syracuse University.
                        Steve has maintained a strong passion for film and entertainment since college. He was initially drawn 
                        to film by films directed by Quentin Tarantino and classic action films. Later in his High School career, Steve was
                        introduced to director David Lynch through the TV show "Twin Peaks". This stregnthened his passion for film
                        even further and it introduced him to a wider world of film. Steve had always written about film for fun
                        and had always wanted to share some of his thoughts with the world. This blog provides Steve the platform to 
                        explore his hobby and share his favorite films with the world.
