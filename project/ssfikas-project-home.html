                    <h3>Army of Darkness: Film Review</h3>

                    <p>
                        Army of Darkness, directed by Sam Raimi, is the finale in
                        the cult classic "Evil Dead" trilogy. The famous horror trilogy,
                        however, ends with a lighthearted and comedic action/adventure film
                        rather than the low-budget campy horror flicks that preceded it. For this reason,
                        Army of Darkness has little reason to be as successful as it is. It is a complete 
                        departure from everything that makes the first two films so famous, and yet it 
                        furthers the lore and the character of Ash, giving them the end they deserve. Packed with
                        slapstick comedy and one-liners, Army of Darkness is a fun watch for sure.

                    <h3>David Lynch: My Favorite Director</h3>
                    <img src="/media/David_Lynch_(1990).jpg" alt= "David Lynch">
                    <p>If you have ever heard something referred to as "Lynchian", chances are 
                        it's very weird. David Lynch's work thrives in the world of weird. 
                        Lynch has mastered the art of surrealist cinema, beginning his career with the 
                        cult classic horror film "Eraserhead", and creating a worldwide phenomenon with his 
                        sensational TV series "Twin Peaks", Lynch has cemented himself as a master of cinema and his films
                        have had a profound impact on me throughout the years. Every time I watch a Lynch film, I am in awe of
                        the incredibly imagery and the disturbingly relevant themes consistent in all of his work.
