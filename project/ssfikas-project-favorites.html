                    <h3>Blue Velvet</h3>
                    <h4>Directed By David Lynch</h4>
                    <p>
                        "Blue Velvet" is an incredibly powerful film. The acting, setting,

                        to create "Evil Dead 2" with much more funding. Bruce Campbell returns as Ash Williams, transforming into
