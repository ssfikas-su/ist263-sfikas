                    <h3>Blue Velvet</h3>
                    <p> Director: David Lynch <br>
                        Year: 1986 <br>
                        Genre: Drama/Thriller
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "Blue Velvet" is an incredibly powerful film. The acting, setting,
                        score, and imagery all provide a one of a kind viewing experience that
                        not many other films can match. "Blue Velvet" is a favorite because upon first viewing,
                        I did not think much of it. However, hours after the credits rolled, images from the film
                        kept reappearing in my mind, and I felt an urge to watch it again. Once watching it again, the film clicked.
                        The reason why "Blue Velvet" is a film that infects your mind. Every image, character, and line is so essential
                        in creating the dark and twisted world that Lynch explores.

                    <h3>Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn</h3>
                    <p> Director: Sam Raimi <br>
                        Year: 1987 <br>
                        Genre: Horror/Comedy
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sam Raimi seemed to use "Evil Dead 2" as a way to make "The Evil Dead" the way he originally intended to.
                        The original film had a famously low budget, but grew a cult following, giving Raimi enough recognition
                        to create "Evil Dead 2" with much more funding. Bruce Campbell returns as Ash Williams, transforming into
                        the quippy action hero most people are familiar with when discussing the character. Evil Dead 2 is a favorite, because as a viewer,
                        it broke all the rules of what a film could be. Part of me was repulsed by the extreme gore and another part of me wanted to laugh
                        at how absurd the action was. I admired the extremely energetic camerawork and vivid colors. This film showed me that a film does not need
                        to fit into one genre, but rather live in its own world, with its own logic.
