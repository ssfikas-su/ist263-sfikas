    <title>Steven Sfikas Project Idea</title>
</head>

<body>
<p[>My idea for my final project is something that I have worked on before and wish to revisit. 
    I would like to create a website to host a film blog. The website will consist of my various 
    reviews or analyses of films that I have seen. The only possible images I would use are movie posters. 
    The various pages will consist of:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>A "browse" page</dt>
        <dd>A page where the user can browse all reviews and content sorted by film</dd>
        <dt>A "favorites" page</dt>
        <dd>A page that discusses and analyzes my favorite works</dd>
        <dt>A home page with an "about me" section</dt>

    </dl>
