<body>
<p>My name is Steven Sfikas and I am a Sophomore at Syracuse University. I am currently studying Information Management and Technology. 
    I am from Mamaroneck, NY and graduated from Scarsdale High School. I plan on concentrating in either web design or data analytics. 
    IT was an interest that I discovered after getting accepted into Syracuse University and I had little previous knowledge about the field.
    My favorite class at the iSchool thus far has been IST 256 because I found python to be challenging and fun.
</p>
<p>My hobbies include collecting music and films. I enjoy watching and occasionally writing about movies . I hope to one day create a website or career
    based on my passion and interests. Using my new knowledge found in the iSchool, I have found that there are many interesting ways in which entertainment and technology
    are related.
